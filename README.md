# CNN Fashion Picture Prediction
This project is a solution to the Fashion MNIST dataset using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The dataset consists of images of clothing items such as t-shirts, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots. The goal of the project is to classify each image into one of these categories.
## Acknowledgements
